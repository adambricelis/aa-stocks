This app utilizes the IEX API for its stock data.
The IEX (Investors Exchange) API allows developers to integrate tools for monitoring and transacting stocks in financial markets. Developers can use the API's endpoints to integrate an analytical portal for prices, market data, and stats. The API currently supports only the HTTP GET methods and conveys requests and responses in JSONP forma and offers access to IEX DEEP, TOPS, stocks, market, and stats data.
